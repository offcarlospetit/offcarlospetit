    Hi, I’m <strong>Carlos Petit</strong> — a passionate Mobile Tech Lead and entrepreneur
    based in Chile. I specialize in building high-performance, cross-platform mobile
    apps using technologies like <strong>React Native</strong>, <strong
      >SwiftUI</strong
    >, and <strong>Kotlin</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently lead the mobile development team at <strong>Banco BICE</strong>,
    where I focus on delivering robust, secure, and user-centric banking
    experiences to thousands of users. My work bridges product strategy, mobile
    architecture, and mentoring engineers to grow and deliver with excellence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m also the founder of <strong>Paymee</strong>, a fintech venture focused
    on international remittances. Our mission is to build smart and inclusive
    financial infrastructure across Latin America, leveraging technology to
    reduce costs and increase transparency for users sending money across
    borders.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a background in engineering and a deep love for problem-solving, I’m
    always learning and pushing the boundaries of what mobile applications can
    do. From real-time apps using sockets and Firebase, to ML-driven features
    and custom UI/UX systems — I approach each challenge with curiosity and
    craftsmanship.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not coding or leading projects, I’m spending time with my family,
    planning the next big idea, or experimenting with new ways to scale
    high-impact products. I believe in building things that matter, with people
    who care.
  </p>

  <p>Let’s connect and build something meaningful.</p>
